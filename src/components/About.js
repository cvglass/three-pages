      <h3>What are morning pages?</h3>
      <p>Morning Pages is a practice popularized by Julia Cameron, author of <u>The Artist's Way</u>. Julia Cameron instructs artists to spend time every morning writing three pages of stream-of-conscious thoughts. This 'mind dump' is designed to clear your mind for the day, help quiet your inner critic, and unblock your creativity.</p>
