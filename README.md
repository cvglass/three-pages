## Three Pages
Daily journal-keeping app with sentiment analysis.

## Motivation
Inspired by Julia Cameron's [Morning Pages](http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) and [750words](http://750words.com/). Morning Pages involves free-writing three pages (cannonically by hand) every morning. The practice is said to clear creative blocks by getting thoughts out of your mind, ignoring your inner critic and get ideas flowing. It's a practice that has benefited me greatly, so I wanted to try creating an app to get the same benefits digitally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
